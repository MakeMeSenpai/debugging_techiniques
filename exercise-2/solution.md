## Bug 2:

0. Asking Questions
Expectations: We should receive the temperature of our entered region in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvins

Results: We are greeted with a server 500 error, indicating server overload or an error within the code.

1. Reading Code
From reading the code I saw that the get did not match the html tag, so I changed it accordingly.
changed users_city to city to match html line 40

I also saw that the url to collect data from our API would be created 

2. Research
Again with the get methods.
